This project demonstrates the utilization of Data Science methodologies to forecast the 2024 outcomes by analyzing data spanning from 2020 to 2023. Focusing on tweets from political party leaders, it serves as a dynamic reflection of political agendas and ideologies. By scrutinizing the temporal evolution of tweet content in response to specific events, the study gauges sentiment levels through tailored social media analysis tools. Moreover, a Fully-Connected Neural Network (FCNN) is leveraged to categorize the political affiliation and leaning (left or right) of tweets. The findings illustrate the FCNN's proficiency in predicting tweet origins with 71â€“75% precision and political leanings with approximately 90% precision. This endeavor serves as a testament to the effective utilization of Twitter data and diverse Data Science tools for political analysis, providing valuable insights into politics, sentiment analysis, and the practical application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Keywords: Politics, Spain, Sentiment analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Neural networks, Natural Language Processing (NLP).
