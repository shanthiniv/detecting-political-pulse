This project showcases the application of Data Science methodologies in analyzing intricate human
communication, focusing on tweets by political party leaders as a dynamic representation of political
agendas and ideologies. Investigating the temporal evolution of tweet content in response to specific events,
we examine sentiment levels using adapted tools for social media analysis. Additionally, we employ a
Fully-Connected Neural Network (FCNN) to classify the political affiliation and leaning (left or right) of
tweets. Results indicate the FCNN's ability to predict tweet origin with 71â€“75% precision and political
leaning with around 90% precision. This study serves as a demonstration of utilizing Twitter data and
diverse Data Science tools for political analysis, offering insights into politics, sentiment analysis, and the
application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Keywords: Politics, Spain, Sentiment analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Neural networks,
